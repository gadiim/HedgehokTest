| **Test Case**                   |
|---------------------------------|
|In the forest, there is a population of hedgehogs. These hedgehogs can only be one of three colors: red, green, or blue. When two hedgehogs of different colors meet, they can change their color to the third one (for example, if a red and a blue hedgehog meet, both can become green). There is no other way for hedgehogs to change their color (i.e., when a red and a blue hedgehog meet, they cannot both turn red, they can only turn into the third color).|
