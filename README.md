## Description
This project is a console-based application built with C# using Visual Studio. The program simulates the management of hedgehog populations across different colonies, performing population adjustments based on user input. The goal is to find the number of rounds needed to balance the populations of different colonies. The program also includes input validation and error handling to ensure proper interaction.

## Task
You can find the task details [here](https://github.com/gadiim/HedgehokTest/blob/main/TASK.md).

### Key Features:
- Input population sizes for three hedgehog colonies.
- Simulate population balance based on user-selected target colonies.
- Handle edge cases and invalid inputs effectively.
- Display results at the end of the simulation.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**: The main programming language used to build this application.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: The IDE used for development and debugging.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gadiim/HedgehokTest.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build and run the project:
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the project.
   - Press Ctrl + F5 to run it without debugging, or F5 to run it with debugging.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input population sizes for the hedgehog colonies and perform the necessary actions.

## Usage

1. When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the population of three hedgehog colonies.
2. After that, you will select which colony should be the target for population balancing.
3. The program will simulate population transfers until the colonies are balanced or the operation is deemed impossible.
4. The final number of rounds and the state of the colonies will be displayed at the end of the simulation.
